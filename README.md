# Deep Learning for Visual Recognition project: U-Net for semantic segmentation.
This is a fork of milesial's U-Net: https://github.com/milesial/Pytorch-UNet, For the Carvana image segmentation competition.
The fork was used for our course on Deep Learning for Visual Recognition.

### Cloning in Google colab

1. Clone the repo in colab
```bash
!git clone https://github.com/slasket/Pytorch-UNet
!cd Pytorch-UNet
```
3. Install dependencies
```bash
!pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Download the data(this requires a kaggle account to get an API Key)
```bash
!bash scripts/download_data.sh
```
4. Training the network
```bash
!python train.py --amp
```
The following text is taken from the original github:
### Running locally

1. [Install CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)

2. [Install PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

3. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Download the data and run training:
```bash
bash scripts/download_data.sh
python train.py --amp
```
### Training

```console
> python train.py -h
usage: train.py [-h] [--epochs E] [--batch-size B] [--learning-rate LR]
                [--load LOAD] [--scale SCALE] [--validation VAL] [--amp]

Train the UNet on images and target masks

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --epochs E, -e E      Number of epochs
  --batch-size B, -b B  Batch size
  --learning-rate LR, -l LR
                        Learning rate
  --load LOAD, -f LOAD  Load model from a .pth file
  --scale SCALE, -s SCALE
                        Downscaling factor of the images
  --validation VAL, -v VAL
                        Percent of the data that is used as validation (0-100)
  --amp                 Use mixed precision
```

By default, the `scale` is 0.5, so if you wish to obtain better results (but use more memory), set it to 1.

Automatic mixed precision is also available with the `--amp` flag. [Mixed precision](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.03740) allows the model to use less memory and to be faster on recent GPUs by using FP16 arithmetic. Enabling AMP is recommended.


### Prediction

After training your model and saving it to `MODEL.pth`, you can easily test the output masks on your images via the CLI.

To predict a single image and save it:

`python predict.py -i image.jpg -o output.jpg`

To predict a multiple images and show them without saving them:

`python predict.py -i image1.jpg image2.jpg --viz --no-save`

```console
> python predict.py -h
usage: predict.py [-h] [--model FILE] --input INPUT [INPUT ...] 
                  [--output INPUT [INPUT ...]] [--viz] [--no-save]
                  [--mask-threshold MASK_THRESHOLD] [--scale SCALE]

Predict masks from input images

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --model FILE, -m FILE
                        Specify the file in which the model is stored
  --input INPUT [INPUT ...], -i INPUT [INPUT ...]
                        Filenames of input images
  --output INPUT [INPUT ...], -o INPUT [INPUT ...]
                        Filenames of output images
  --viz, -v             Visualize the images as they are processed
  --no-save, -n         Do not save the output masks
  --mask-threshold MASK_THRESHOLD, -t MASK_THRESHOLD
                        Minimum probability value to consider a mask pixel white
  --scale SCALE, -s SCALE
                        Scale factor for the input images
```
You can specify which model file to use with `--model MODEL.pth`.

## Weights & Biases

The training progress can be visualized in real-time using [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/).  Loss curves, validation curves, weights and gradient histograms, as well as predicted masks are logged to the platform.

When launching a training, a link will be printed in the console. Click on it to go to your dashboard. If you have an existing W&B account, you can link it
 by setting the `WANDB_API_KEY` environment variable.

## Data
The Carvana data is available on the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/c/carvana-image-masking-challenge/data).

You can also download it using the helper script:

```
bash scripts/download_data.sh
```

The input images and target masks should be in the `data/imgs` and `data/masks` folders respectively (note that the `imgs` and `masks` folder should not contain any sub-folder or any other files, due to the greedy data-loader). For Carvana, images are RGB and masks are black and white.

You can use your own dataset as long as you make sure it is loaded properly in `utils/data_loading.py`.
